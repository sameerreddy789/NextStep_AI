## 🏆 Hackathon Demo Guide

**For Judges & Presenters:** This project is **Hackathon Ready**.

### 🛡️ Fail-Safe Demo Mode
The AI service includes a robust **Fallback Mechanism**. If the Gemini API is rate-limited or unreachable during the presentation, the system will automatically serve high-quality pre-generated interview questions. **The demo will not crash.**

### 🌟 Key Flows to Showcase
1.  **Resume Analysis**: Upload a resume to see the "Magic Scanning" animation and skill extraction (simulated for speed).
2.  **AI Interview**:
    -   Start a "Mixed" interview.
    -   Show the **Monaco Editor** integration.
    -   Demonstrate **Speech-to-Text** (allows for natural answers).
    -   Show the **Toast Notifications** (try submitting empty code).
3.  **Roadmap**: Generate a personalized roadmap based on the interview performance.
